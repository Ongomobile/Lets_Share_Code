## How To Use

Since this is all about contributing to open source. What you need to do to contribute is to fork the repository then start your own branch on your local machine. Then when you want to contribute something to the repository put in a pull request. The administrators will review and merge your pull request into the master branch. Just try to keep things on topic and consistent and please no self promotion.
